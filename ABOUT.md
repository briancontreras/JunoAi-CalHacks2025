# Juno

**Empowering immigrants and communities with knowledge, voice, and protection.**

## Overview

*Juno* is a tool designed to help individuals, especially immigrants, understand and assert their rights when interacting with law enforcement or local authorities. The system allows users to:

- Access legal rights based on state,and federal laws
- Get guidance on how to navigate future interactions

## Why We Built This

Many community members—especially immigrants—feel vulnerable during encounters with authorities due to language gaps, legal uncertainty, or fear. *Juno* empowers users with knowledge, emotional support, and a practical toolset to protect their rights.

## Key Features

- **Location-based rights lookup** for personalized legal insight
- **Conversational AI** that helps users feel prepared and informed

## Privacy and Security

Security is a core principle of *Juno*. We prioritize:

- Transparent data use policies
- Local or consent-based data storage

## Status

This project is being developed as part of the UC Berkeley AI Hackathon—rapid prototyping in progress!
